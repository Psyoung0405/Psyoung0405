### 🫶🏻Welcome to Psyoung0405's github🫶🏻
🙌🏻 Hi~ I'm sinyoung.  

I'm majoring in an English education.  

I'm learning a Python code for the first time.😊  

I'm unfamiliar with many things, but I'll work hard to learn and build my GitHub repository into something impressive.  

🧐 Oh, do you wonder the dog in my profile?

She is my sister's dog!🐶  Isn't she cute?🤩🤍
